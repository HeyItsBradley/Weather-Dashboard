# Weather Dashboard

## Description

My motivations for this projects was wanting to be able to see the weather forecast. I built this so i would be able to get a concise view of the weather and the next 5 day forecast. This solves the problem of not knowing what the weather is current like and will be. I learned how to use apis to call data and display them on screen.
